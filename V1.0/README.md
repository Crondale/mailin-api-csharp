# README

This is the official SendinBlue API C# library.

 * The primary dependency is Newtonsoft's JSON .NET library. 
 * This is compatible with .NET 4.0 and above due to the usage of dynamic objects. 
 * This was developed using Open source SharpDevelop IDE.

## About the setup

 * The SendinBlue project is the core wrapper library.
 * The test project is a sample C# console application that references the library and gets all campaigns.
 * You can explore the source code for all the calls, or well use the IDE autocomplete to explore more.
